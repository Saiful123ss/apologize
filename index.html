        <h2>For You...</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m not enoughâ€¦ and I get scared that one day youâ€™ll walk away.  
          But the truth is, you mean more to me than I can ever explain.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I donâ€™t need anything fancy, I just need you.  
          Even when things are hard, even when I mess upâ€¦  
          I still want you here, by my side.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Please donâ€™t let go of me.  
          Stayâ€¦ even if itâ€™s messy, even if itâ€™s not perfect.  
          Because losing you would be the saddest thing I could ever face.  
        </p>
        <p class="signature">â€” I just want you to stay â€”</p>
